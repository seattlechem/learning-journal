## Learning Journal Day 6

Today we learned about Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM tree is a model of a web page. One can access and create elements, and further set values. We also learned about domain modeling. It is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem.
During the lab, we were assigned to solve the real world problem domain into code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements.
