## Learning Journal Day 4

Today we learned about how functions work in Javascript. We talked about how functions take parameters and how return works in functions.

We also reviewed CSS layout including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, and fixed. Teacher Allie demonstrated that in a situation where there is a parent and child elements, you always set parent as relative and child as absolute.

During our lab time, we performed our first paired programming excercise. We wrapped each other's guess game questions into functions.
