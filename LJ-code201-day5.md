## Learning Journal Day 5

Today we learned about <img>. It has tree attributes: src, alt, and title. We learned that title attribute is particulary valuable for visually impaired individuals. We also learned that .DS_Store file in Apple MacOS should be added into .gitignore.
<img> is an inline element and images should be adjusted by providing either width or height, so that the given image can be auto adjusted.

When writing functions, you can return multiple variables by grouping as array. 

Also, we learned about how to create a branch and merge it with master.
