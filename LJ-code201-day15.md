## Learning Journal Day 14

Today our instructor Allie went over what we can expect from 301 class. In addition, we also went over what approach we need to take during our group project week. We learned that respecting one another is very important when we're doing a group project.
During our lab, we did an excercise where we created an github merge conflict, and learned how to resolve this merge conflicts if and when happen. Our group also discussed about what we will do for our group project. We decided to create a trivia question web app.
