## Learning Journal Day 2

Today was another busy learning day here at CodeFellows. We learned about arrays and array methods. I was aware of several methods such as  `.pop()`, `.push()`, and etc... The instructor showed a website (MDN: Mozilla Developer Network) where more details information can be reviewed later on.

The instructor also went over github. We learned that it's best to make commits often as possible.

Today was second day, but I already feel overwhelmed by all this tasks. I will work harder to catch up.
