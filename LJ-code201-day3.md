## Learning Journal Day 3

Today we learned about Box Model & how to apply css on these. I used to abuse using divs in the past, but I learned it is best practice to use semantic tags, such as <section>, <nav>, <article>, etc...
We also learned about applying class or id on items. The difference between class and id are (1) class is for items occur more than once, and (2) id is for the one specific item.
We learned how to apply, margin, border, padding while learning about Trouble (Top, Right, Bottom, Left) rule. 
We also learned about for loop, do while loop, and while do loop. Do While loop will execute at least once whereas While Do loop may not execute anything.
